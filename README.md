# Producthunt Project

This is a **Django-based** Project. This web application is similar to popular tech and geek forum Product Hunt. Individuals can add their products to share with other users and other users may upvote products based on their choice. Authentication feature was implemented too. A user must be logged in before adding a product or upvoting a product, otherwise the website will redirect him/her to the signup page. **PostgreSQL** database technology was used to implement this project. Icons were added with the help of Iconic.
